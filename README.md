This project aims to provide a quick computerized method to find possible restriction mappings from a list of digests. 
As the name suggests, it works with any number of digests, and can find a solution for n enzymes, given n+1 digests that are well-conditioned -
(irl case, but someone using this for an assignment or test question may find that the inputs are especially duplicitous at times)
In the ill-conditioned case, it will generate a family of possible solutions - as mathematically required. 

The script was made with 100% Python and some matplotlib - unfortunately, a couple people lack this on their pc and I'm desperate for github views.
Hence, a teeny-tiny bit is html and it's wrapped with Flask. 
Another 6 hours was spent installing Ubuntu and the associated networking stack. 
Now this accursed program currently lives at http://99.247.72.72/, hosted from a laptop in my furnace room with a broken trackpad and a cracked screen.

A writeup will be added when my eyes feel less dry.
